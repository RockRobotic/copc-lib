    """Scaffolding for reading COPC files in a multithreaded way to increase performance.
    It queues all nodes from either the provided list of nodes or nodes within the given resolution to be processed.
    Within the multiprocess, `read_function` is called with `read_function_args` keyword arguments, as well as the
        keyword arguments "points", "node", and "reader".
        This function should take those parameters and return a pickleable object that represents those points -
            for example, a list of XYZ points limited by classification.
        Note that whatever is returned from this function must be wrapped in a dictionary,
            because the return values get passed as keyword arguments to `callback_function`.
    The return value of `read_function`, as well as the currently processed node, is passed back to the main thread,
        where `callback_function` is called with the node and the return values of `read_function` as keyword arguments.
        This function can aggregate your results as they back from the multithreading.

    Args:
        reader (copclib.CopcReader): A copc reader for the file you are reading
        read_function (function): A function which takes each input node and its points and
            returns a pickleable object as output.
        read_function_args (dict, optional): A key/value pair of keyword arguments to pass to the read_function. Defaults to {}.
        nodes (list[copc.Node], optional): A list of nodes to run the reader on. Defaults to reading all the nodes.
        resolution (float, optional): If a list of nodes is not provided, reads all nodes up to this resolution.
            Defaults to reading all nodes.
        progress (tqdm.tqdm, optional): A TQDM progress bar to track progress. Defaults to None.
        completed_callback (function, optional): A function which is called after a node is processed
            and returned from multiprocessing. Defaults to None.
        chunk_size (int, optional): Limits the amount of nodes which are queued for multiprocessing at once. Defaults to 1024.
        max_workers (int, optional): Manually set the number of processors to use when multiprocessing. Defaults to all processors.
