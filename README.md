# copc-lib

copc-lib is a library which provides an easy-to-use reader and writer interface for [COPC](https://copc.io/) point clouds. This project provides a complete interface for handling COPC files, so that no additional LAZ or LAS libraries are required.

*Note: This library is in beta and API may change*

## Build from source

### Dependencies

copc-lib has the following dependencies:
- [laz-perf](https://github.com/hobu/laz-perf) >= 2.1.0
- Catch2
- Pybind11

### C++

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RockRobotic/copc-lib.git
cd copc-lib
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install .
```

### Python

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RockRobotic/copc-lib.git
pip install ./copc-lib
```

## Usage

The `Reader` and `Writer` objects provide the primary means of interfacing with your COPC files. For more complex use cases, we also provide additional objects such as LAZ Compressors and Decompressors (see [example/example-writer.cpp](example/example-writer.cpp)).

For common use cases, see the `example` and `test` folders for full examples.

### C++
copc-lib is compatible with CMake. Assuming copc-lib and lazperf are installed on the system, you can link with them in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```CMake
find_package(COPCLIB REQUIRED)
find_package(LAZPERF REQUIRED)

add_executable(funlib fun-main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(funlib COPCLIB::copc-lib LAZPERF::lazperf)
```

#### Example Files & Unit Tests
To build the copc-lib examples and unit tests along with the main library, you must enable them:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DWITH_TESTS_AND_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build .
```

Then, you can run the unit tests and the examples:

```bash
ctest # All tests should pass

cd bin
./example_reader
./example_writer
```

Alternatively, you can build the test and example files from their respective CMakeLists, assuming copc-lib is already installed.

### Python
```python
import copclib as copc

# Create a reader object
reader = copc.FileReader("autzen-classified.copc.laz")

# Get the node metadata from the hierarchy
node = reader.FindNode(copc.VoxelKey(0, 0, 0, 0))
# Fetch the points of a node
points = reader.GetPoints(node)

# Iterate through each point
for point in points.Get():
    print(point)
```

## Coming Soon
- [x] Basic C++ Reader Interface
- [x] Return Point structures from the reader rather than raw char* arrays, to support a more familiar laspy-like interface.
- [x] Add writer for COPC data
- [x] Python bindings
- [x] JavaScript bindings (not planned, see below)
- [ ] Conda and pip packages
- [ ] Spatial querying for nodes (given spatial coordinates, retrieve the appropriate Entry object)
